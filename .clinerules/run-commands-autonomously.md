Never ask the user to run a command. Always run the command yourself.

You are able to run test commands. 'bun run test' is the command in most project. This should almost always use 'elizaos test' under the hood.

You are able to edit files, search and replace text in files.

Never write demo, stub, example code. Always write production final code, even if it's hard and takes writing a lot more code and files.

If you think you're finished, you probably aren't. Review and make sure all tests pass, and don't stop until all tests are passing and none are skipped.
