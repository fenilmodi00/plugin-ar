KEEP IT SIMPLE!

Always implement real working code, never examples or shortcuts-- those just cause problems in the future.

If you're not sure, ask me about something, I know a lot about the system.

Don't create new files unless you need to. Revise existing files whenever possible. It makes cleanup much easier in the future. Instead of creating a _v2.ts, just update the v1.

IF you write docs, store them in the /docs folder

If you save logs, store them in the /logs folder
